# chrome100-json

JSON version of the Chrome100 database

## Usage

This is a drop-in replacement for the JSON that used to be hosted on the `chrome100.dev` site at `/_next/data/<build id>/board/<board>.json` - just point your existing applications at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainestorme/chrome100-json/main/boards/<board>.json`.

## Notice something broken?

This repo should automatically update itself as [chrome-versions](https://github.com/e9x/chrome-versions) does. If it doesn't... then you should probably open an issue.
